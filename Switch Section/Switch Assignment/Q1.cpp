This is a Challenging Question  (Not an Assignment): 

   Write a program using Switch that simply solve roots of a the quadratic equation.

   What's the Quadratic Equation? 
        (a)x^2 + (b)y + (c) = 0
    
    where a, b, c are real numbers. 

    To get roots for this equation there's cases (2 cases).
    Using Switch-cases write the each case.

    Hints:
        - you can use 2 nested switch :P :P
        - a good hint: https://goo.gl/btE2yH 

    Input  = a, b, c (3 variables)
    Output = 2 roots (2 variables)


Test your code:
 Input  = 4 -2 -10
 Output =  1.85 -1.35
